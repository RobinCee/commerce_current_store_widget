INTRODUCTION
------------

This module implements a simple block that renders the current store.

It requires Commerce 2.x, at least Drupal 8.3.x.


INSTALLATION
------------

Installation is like any other module, just place the files in the modules
directory and enable the module on the 'Extend' page.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Add the block via the block layout page to any region you like.

Then visit the permissions page and grant access to the roles you want to be
able to view the current store block.

Now clear the site's cache and visit a page where the block should render.
